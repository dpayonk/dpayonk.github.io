If you love food, it's almost impossible to beat Chicago.  Dollar for dollar, Chicago
delivers the best food experiences.  Here's a condensed list of the restaurants
I'd recommend that you might not have heard about when you think of Chicago.  If
you spend more than a week here, check these out.

+ Pequod's

Forget Gino's East or Lou Malnati's, this is the best deep dish pizza in town when
cooked right.  The caramelized crust is spectacular and the italian sausage crumbles
awesome.

+ Brick's Pizza

When most people think of Chicago, they think of deep dish pizza.  I'll tell you
most people eat way more thin crust pizza in Chicago than deep dish.  And Brick's
is my favorite.  I'm not a fan of BBQ pizza at all, but the sweet heat is not
a normal BBQ pizza.  It's a BBQ tomato sauce and the difference is noticeable.

Also, make sure to get the slutty ravioli, a great appetizer for the cheese lover.

+ La Gondola

Don't let the locations fool you, I'd recommend this over nearly any Italian food
in the city.  The minestrone soup is absolutely incredible.  My wife and I have
spent $100s of dollars trying to reverse engineer it.

+ Sienna Tavern

Alright, this one is probably on the list now, but it's still worth mentioning.
If you have a lunch slot available, it's a must try when you're downtown or in River
North.  Make sure to try the Sienna Meatball.

+ Lawrence's Fishery

You're probably not going to try this if you're an out of towner, but every Chicagoan
should make a trek down to the south side on Canal for Lawrence's.  The best fried
seafood menu in the city, it's a childhood favorite.

+ Little Goat

This is also on the list, but let's be honest, you're probably not going to get in
at the Girl and the Goat.  This place more than makes up for it, and the value for
the quality is worth it.  The Corned Beef Hash is superb, using sliced Corned Beef
instead of the canned stuff.  Everything they cook is local in some way and you
can taste the freshness.

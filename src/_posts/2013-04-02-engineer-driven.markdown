I've become fascinated with small startup companies showing impressive abilities
to scale businesses without the linear overhead of adding engineers.  In an
economy where good engineers are scarce, I think it's important to utilize them
effectively and keep them happy and intellectually stimulated.  I don't believe
the talent economy for engineers is going to change anytime soon without government
intervention, so it's going to be as important as ever to retain good engineers.
Having said that, what are some ways to promote and create an organizational
structure to maximize engineer productivity and keep a pleasant culture?

Looking at some of the companies I currently admire
(Google, Apple, Amazon, Rackspace, Github, Instagram, Nordstrom, BrainTree, LinkedIn, and Square), I
think more companies should adopt some of their practices for retaining engineering talent.
Google had/has 20% time and a ridiculously differentiated infrastructure platform.  Lesser known
(and no idea if it's still in play) is an email and NLP time tracking platform that
helps ELIMINATE WASTE from the project management process.  I watched a Google Tech Talk
mention that the Google+ engineers could go from code commit to production in less than 36 hours.
Their AUTOMATED testing platform (enabled by their infrastructure) runs hundreds of
millions of tests a year and allows them to do this.

Github has grown in the last 4 years with a distributed workforce and no managers.
They trust that people will work towards making the product better without supervision.
To automate deployments and infrastructure, they built a robot (Hubot) they can chat
with to perform monotonous tasks engineers hate doing.  They try and make all their applications
available with a bootstrap script that lets them dive into the application with one command.
Instagram hit the scene in a hurry and spread virally as fast or faster than anything before it.
They were what I would consider mainstream with 3 full time engineers.  Instagram isn't exactly
"organizing all the world's information" but was in heavy use by a lot of people.  They utilized
many cloud technologies, open source projects, and AUTOMATION to deliver this with such a small staff.

Square helped bring e-commerce payments mainstream.  I love seeing a cab pull out
the Square reader to help them bypass those ridiculous fees charged by cab companies
to this day (although that is quickly being usurped by Uber).  Square is operating without
product managers.  Part of that is size, but they believe it is because their engineers
can understand beyond pure technical specifications what features make their products more attractive.
They TRUST engineers TO MAKE BUSINESS DECISIONS.  Even more powerful perhaps is the pace of innovation
this philosophy allows.  If the engineer understands the product direction as well,
they can ITERATE on a feature in their head FASTER than any communication can allow.

To summarize, there are 3 themes I believe you should use when developing an engineering team.
ELIMINATE WASTE, AUTOMATE, and TRUST ENGINEERS TO MAKE BUSINESS DECISIONS.  There are hundreds of
other reasons these companies are effective, but I believe you can apply some of these
principles to create better organizations.

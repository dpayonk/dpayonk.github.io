One year ago, at this time, I was itching to get back to work and took an engagement 
at a company whose long term value proposition was not clear in my opinion.  I had finally 
lost almost 30 lbs that I had gained in the two previous years at [XSELL.](http://www.xselltechnologies.com)  
I was convinced I figured out how to balance the two.

Soon after, an opportunity to come back to the healthcare industry came up and
since then I've been working on developing my consulting and product business
a la Basecamp (formerly 37 signals).  I've been working furiously ever since.

I decided I wanted to emulate the 37 signals model because it offered
me the right balance of impact and happiness.  I won't be working from
9 to 5 anytime soon, but I get to work on interesting projects with people
whose company I enjoy.

However, in the midst of growing the business, it's been an ongoing struggle
to keep my weight down, body healthy, and mind fresh while working furiously.
I know that I'm currently losing the battle right now, but it comes as I get
closer to growing my business.  The proposition is almost that to grow my 
business, I must be unhealthy.  

I think I'm okay with the tradeoff.  However, I still would like to be conscientious of 
*when* I'm making it.  And, have a plan in place to not swing the pendulum too 
far the other way for too long.  This has created the need for someone I'd like
to think of as a lifestyle coach.

I don't need constant or professional feedback all the time, but someone to help

me here & there.  This is especially helpful since Amanda is going through many of 
the same struggles at work.

We've done a reasonable job as a team finding small wins and keeping our [whealth](https://www.whealthy.us) 
reasonable.  Our pedometers help keep our activity level from being sedentary.  We've signed up for [Blue Apron](https://www.blueapron.com/) 
and [Sprig](https://www.sprig.com/#/order/chi) to cut down on **eating** out so much.  We have 
our weekly softball league for some activity.  And, we got our friends together and signed up 
for a Friday night volleyball league to avoid ***too much*** happy hour and keep us active.

But really, the issue that being a little bit healthy is so much more conscientious effort 
than being a little unhealthy.  To add fuel, at least in our social circle, staying social usually 
ends up with a few cocktails at some point in the night.

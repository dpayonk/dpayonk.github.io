How Great Leaders inspire action
What does XSELL do?
How do they do it?
Why does XSELL exist?
Start with why, then how, and last what
People buy why you do it…not what you do
What do I believe?
Got to get above 16% (innovators and early adopters)
People don’t buy what you do…they buy why you do it
Apple believes you should think different
I buy apple because I think you should think different
Why do I buy Apple
Why do I buy Verizon
Those who lead inspire us

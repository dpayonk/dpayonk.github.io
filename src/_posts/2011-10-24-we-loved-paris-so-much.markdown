I decided we should stay another day.  The extra day gave us an opportunity
to enjoy the great weather at the Luxembourg Gardens and reflect on the
trip (hence the blog post).  It was incredible to spend two weeks away
from it all with just Amanda.  As Archita pointed out, she truly
is easy to love (and gets grouchy if not fed regularly).  During the course
of my trip, I've observed a few things I think would be nice if they translated
into the states.

##The two flush toilet

It's just less wasteful.

##Smaller cars

I love smaller cars.  Big cars seem so wasteful, especially when just 1 person is driving.

##Coins

Get rid of the dollar bill.  Replace them with $1 and $2 coins.
I can go out and get a meal with just a pocketful of change.

##Make meal times meaningful

I spend every day at work trying to eat as quickly as possible.  I think this contributes
to many bad habits I've accumulated over the years.  I think putting a priority on meal
time would and not rushing through it would be one of the best things we could
do for our population health as a whole.

The average body type is very slender and I don't think it can entirely be contributed to
their adoration of smoking.

##A glass of wine in the park

As we spent the day in the Gardens, Amanda pointed out that we have great parks
in Chicago and we never seem to spend time there.  You might think it's the
mild weather or the culture, but I think the reason is simple.  Alcohol is allowed.
A simple change allowing "personal" consumption of beer and wine could make the parks
in Chicago even more popular than they are now.

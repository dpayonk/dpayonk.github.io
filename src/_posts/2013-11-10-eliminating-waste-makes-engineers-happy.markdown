##Eliminating waste makes engineers happy

Let's first eliminate waste.  You won't find anyone in business that doesn't agree with that.  But let's think about an example that results in the failure to do this.  The best example I can think of is creating processes and its resulting process documentation for comfort, risk mitigation, and a lack of desire to invest in automation.  I'm not advocating chaos, let's consider a few scenarios.
Say an email blast fails every 4 days.  An easy way to fix the problem (an email not being delivered) is to create a process that somebody checks it every day so that they can restart the email process if it fails.  It doesn't take a whole lot of anyone's time, but it now suffers from a single point of failure.  If that person forgets or is sick, it doesn't get done.  The first time it fails, someone is held accountable and then creates a process to resolve this.  Instead of looking at the problem of email not being delivered, the problem changes to "how to fix when X forgets or is sick."  That now requires two people (twice the time and energy plus the overhead spent in dreaming up the process).  Now, we've just created waste.
Why does that make the engineer unhappy?  Well, first of all, no engineer likes being associated with systems (human or machine) that have single points of failure. This creates guilt on the end of the engineer and will result in unhappiness down the road.  Second of all, engineers hate following rules for rules sake. That's not to say they're not law abiding citizens (usually they are because they are risk averse), but just following rules inhibits your ability to be creative.
So, how do you solve this, after all, emails are failing every couple days.  I think that failure creates the perfect opportunity to make it a burning platform and actually resolve that.  First, fixing it correctly usually will result in eliminating a single point of failure (win).  Second, it will eliminate waste by recovering the time Tommy is currently spending on ensuring it works, and prevents future waste in documentation of process that would have resulted after Tommy forgets to check.

I've used NodeJS for quite a few projects, and most of the projects
tend to be of the microservice variety.  The code is small & fast
and performs like such.

I've finally decided I should take the necessary time to learn
how Node scales to a larger software project.  Instead of trying
to create a really big project for no reason, I decided to look
at an existing project and find some need I had and then go ahead
and modify it.

After looking around, I decided [Ghost.](https://tryghost.org)  It seemed an
obvious solution for me, as I despise WordPress and was in the market
for a publishing platform that would work better than my single user
Middleman or Octopress blog.  After downloading and running the code
first, I decided to poke around and try to integrate Ghost into my
devise Ruby apps.  The first thing I came across that I hadn't looked at
in any detail was the concept of promises.

# JavaScript Promises

## Promises use exception handling for "control flow"

## Passing parameters to the functions is implicit

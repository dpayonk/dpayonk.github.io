Being in a knowledge based industry means constantly learning new things
and learning how to apply these new concepts to future problems.
It's similar to staying in shape.  If you're not staying in shape, you're
getting out of shape.  Given the importance of learning in my industry, I
thought it wise to spend some time learning about the subject of "learning."
After googling the subject, I believe I'd be classified in Kolb's model
as being a [Converger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_style).  To summarize,
I understand things abstractly but need active experimentation to really learn
the material.

Getting tactical for a moment, I start by first reading articles
(minimum 3 and 2 wikis) on the subject at hand and doing a "versus" search to distinguish the concept
from other concepts in the solution domain.  After researching and orienting myself
to the concept, I then evaluate the priority to determine if it's worth my time.
After all, the list of things that interests me is practically endless.

Once I've decided the concept is worthy of mastering or having working knowledge,
I try to find a small problem I ***actually*** have that may be worthwhile solving this way.
Once I find a problem to solve, I learn by mimicking.  It usually involved some form of
copy/paste until I've worked through the problem.

Over the course of time, I've found this approach to be faster for concept building
than a tutorials.  It's more painful in the beginning, but I find it results in
a deeper understanding afterwards.

With time and experience, I've come to appreciate a key learning about me and
my converger method.  I've learned what it feels like during the struggling
stage.  I have more perseverance now and don't feel as overwhelmed or discouraged
as I once did.  Most importantly, I've gained a confidence about my intelligence.
I suggest you take the time to do assess your learning style and analyze it for
potential improvements.

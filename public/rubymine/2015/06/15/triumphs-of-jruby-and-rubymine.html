  <article class="post-content">
    <p>For over five years now, my preferred language has been Ruby, and specifically 
JRuby.  I loved Ruby for the rapid prototyping it allowed me to do.  I loved how reading it 
could feel like pseudocode.  It felt self documenting if you were following 
the community conventions.  I loved the idea of running on the JVM and importing 
all the great academic libraries available.  Once in production, it flew.<br />
You could claim you were on the JVM to the enterprise while winning the 
hearts of developers with the pure joy of Ruby.  But, it had some 
serious challenges still.</p>

<h2 id="jruby-felt-like-its-own-language">JRuby felt like its own language</h2>

<p>The whole concept of writing in Ruby and then deploy on JRuby didn’t work well, even for simple things.  JDBC ActiveRecord required completely different configuration.  Connection strings had to be different.  A bunch of cool libraries had C extensions.  You had to commit to using JRuby from the very beginning.  You could really feel it when you cloned an app from Github and tried to run it on JRuby.  C extensions, yuck.</p>

<p>It never really bothered me much, as I knew I had to allot time for that.  Plus, the products I was making suffered from the reverse problem.  They incorporated a bunch of Java jars.</p>

<h2 id="the-developdebug-workflow-was-ugly">The develop/debug workflow was ugly</h2>

<p>For me personally, this was my biggest complaint.  The develop/debug workflow for mundane issues was just painful.  I was used to Visual Studio and visually speaking, Ruby was not at that level.  Sure, you could open Pry and add debugger statements.  But, for a visual person, it just wasn’t well put together.</p>

<p>I mean, it felt like with every point release, there was a new way of doing things.  There were always some issue that made it a config hassle to get things working smoothly.</p>

<p>But I think the Ruby community has triumphed over this one.  Rubymine 7 came out and I haven’t had a single issue.  Plus, visual debugging ACTUALLY works.  Like, out of the box.  I actually prefer to hit the play button on Rubymine now vs a command line “rails s” to launch a server.</p>

<h2 id="starting-up-jruby-was-slow">1) Starting up JRuby was slow.</h2>

<p>Like real slow.  I suffered in silence  And then JRuby 1.7.10 came out.  And Drip came out.  And now, it’s not so bad.</p>

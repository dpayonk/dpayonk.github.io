  <article class="post-content">
    <h1 id="the-highlights">The Highlights</h1>
<ul>
  <li>I have a passion integrating data into products.</li>
  <li>I’m a pragmatist and prefer working with businesses that are financially sustainable &amp; intend to be profitable.</li>
  <li>I love using data and analytics to create ways to think different &amp; take action on a problem.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-longer-version">The Longer Version</h1>

<p>A technology entrepreneur at heart, I have always loved figuring out ways to put
data to work in applications.  I’ve been several roles of leadership at startups
in different stages of their history.  The first one I was part of IPO’d and really
got me addicted to value creation.  I’ve led a few others to being cash flow positive
and another to being bought.  My leadership style is about embracing the
intelligence of the team and challenging people to unleash their potential.</p>

<p>I started my career at <a href="http://www.accretivehealth.com">Accretive Health</a> where
I grew into a number of technology leadership roles in infrastructure, software development,
and data analytics.  My focus primarily consisted of delivering an analytics enabled
software platform to deliver sustainable revenue cycle improvements.  It was there
that the entrepreneurial bug bit me.  I loved every part of the rapid growth, high
performance culture, and figuring things out along the way.  Following a successful
IPO, I became anxious for a new challenge and wanted to move into the consumer
software space.  I also wanted to make a move back to the Nix world of technology.</p>

<p><strong><em>I won’t look be looking back.  I love Linux, Java, Ruby, Bash. Heck, even Mono.</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http:///www.youswoop.com">Youswoop</a>, my next venture, was a social commerce website
providing local experiences for a variety of services and experiences at great
prices.  We offered curated experiences for everything: food &amp; hospitality, health &amp; beauty,
sports &amp; events, travel &amp; recreation, retail services.  At YouSwoop, I architected
their secure, socially enabled e-commerce website.  I focused on building a great
customer experience powered by predictive analytics.  In August of 2013, Youswoop
was bought.</p>

<p>In early 2012, I was approached to help start a “built for purpose” company in the
customer experience space focused on using analytics to create great sales experiences.
XSELL combines natural language processing, data science, and a collegiate salesforce
to deliver superior online sales experiences.  I was responsible for developing
product strategy, building Engineering and Data Science teams, and printer problems.  After a successful pivot into
the telecom space, I’m proud to say XSELL is cash flow positive and on track for great success and fast growth.</p>

<p>I was born, raised, and love Chicago.  I love the <a href="/chicago-food">food</a>, the people,
and the summer.  I’m not a huge fan of the winter, flatness, and traffic. I’m always
interested in helping other entrepreneurs and receiving feedback, so please reach
out.  Seriously, I promise I will respond with enthusiasm.</p>
